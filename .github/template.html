        <h2>Malek Farley-Gray</h2>
        <p>My educational goal is to get a bachelors degree in computer science software engineer.It was always a dream of mine to do it but i did not make the best choices growing up.I had choose the wrong path but i always had a love and passion for computers and the software.My older brother and father always told me why dont you stop wasting you time running the streets and go back to school and get a degree.And i made a promise them if i every got the chance to get outta mt home state i would go back to school and finish high school and go to college right after that.So here i am today working on the second part of my promise to them.And the reason it means so much to me to complete this promise and this goal of mine.Is because my older brother and father is no longer here with me i lost both of them soem years ago back to back it was my older brother that got killed first and then the next year i got locked up and my father died when i was locked up.So i was blessed with the chance to move from where im from and now im here in arizona following my dream and chasing my dream and also completing a promise all in the same time im so proud of myself i came a very long way.</p>
